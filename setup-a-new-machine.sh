#
# homebrew!
#
# (google machines are funny so i have to do this. everyone else should use the regular thang)
mkdir $HOME/.homebrew && curl -L https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/tarball/master | tar xz --strip 1 -C $HOME/.homebrew
export PATH=$HOME/.homebrew/bin:$HOME/.homebrew/sbin:$PATH
#
# install all the things
./brew.sh
./brew-cask.sh




# github.com/jamiew/git-friendly
# the `push` command which copies the github compare URL to my clipboard is heaven
#bash < <( curl https://raw.github.com/jamiew/git-friendly/master/install.sh)


# Type `git open` to open the GitHub page or website for a repository.
#npm install -g git-open


# github.com/rupa/z   - oh how i love you
git clone https://github.com/rupa/z.git ~/code/z
chmod +x ~/code/z/z.sh
# consider reusing your current .z file if possible. it's painful to rebuild :)
# z hooked up in .bash_profile


# github.com/thebitguru/play-button-itunes-patch
# disable itunes opening on media keys
#git clone https://github.com/thebitguru/play-button-itunes-patch ~/code/play-button-itunes-patch


# my magic photobooth symlink -> dropbox. I love it.
#  + first move Photo Booth folder out of Pictures
#  + then start Photo Booth. It'll ask where to put the library.
#  + put it in Dropbox/public
# * Nowâ€¦ you can record photobooth videos quickly and they upload to dropbox DURING RECORDING
# * then you grab public URL and send off your video message in a heartbeat.


# for the c alias (syntax highlighted cat)
#sudo easy_install Pygments


# change to bash 4 (installed by homebrew)
